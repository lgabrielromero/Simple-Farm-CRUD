# Simple-Farm-CRUD
A simple interface with a CRUD for farm products using NodeJs.
I used MongoDB and connected it with Mongoose. Then used Express for requests.



## how to:
You need to use MongoDB an exec seeds.js with Node to fill the db with the first 5 items.
after that, just exec index.js and start using.





## list of products
A list of products with a category filter. Every product in the database is here.
You can filter by categories (Fruit, Vegetable, Dairy) and enter every item to see it's price and category.

## add product
Add here your custom products! You can enter a decimal or whole number in the price.

## modify products
Here you'll find every item in the db and you can access to its information to edit it or remove the product.
You can to change the information as you want and click MODIFY button to validate.
Below the BACK button, there is the REMOVE button, to delete the entry from the db.




## This is just a test, so i didn't apply css. The main focus here goes to Routing, Request handling and working with the db, to try a rest crud.

If you try it, please, give me some advices or feedback to keep learning. 
## Thank You!
